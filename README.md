  The final year industry experience project, act as a team coordinator and a developer in a team.
  
This project will design and construct a web portal that will be utilised as a communication tool between clinicians and patients with gestational diabetes. The web portal will replace MyGDMâ€™s existing legacy system, and will also provide educational resources for both the patients and general public. Additionally, the web portal will allow patients from the clinic to enter their personal health information, which will be monitored by clinicians in order to manage their health and provide effective responses in accordance to the emergency ranking of the patients.
